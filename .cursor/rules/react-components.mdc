# Component Patterns

- Use named exports for components, default exports only for pages
- Define props with `type` instead of `interface` for component props
- Colocate types with their components unless shared across files
- Use `loading.tsx` and `error.tsx` for route-level states
- Use Next.js `Image` component for optimized image rendering
- Prefer `Link` from `next/link` for client-side navigation
