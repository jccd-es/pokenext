# PokeNext Project Conventions

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 16 with App Router and Server Components
- TypeScript with strict mode
- Tailwind CSS 4 for styling
- shadcn/ui (New York style) with Radix UI primitives
- PokéAPI v2 as data source

## Code Style

- All code, variables, comments, and messages in English
- Use functional components with TypeScript types (avoid `any`)
- Prefer Server Components; use `"use client"` only when necessary
- Use `cn()` from `@/lib/utils` for conditional class merging
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility

## Project Structure

- `app/` — Pages and layouts (App Router)
- `components/ui/` — Reusable UI components (shadcn/ui)
- `lib/` — Utility functions and API helpers

## API Integration

- Use native `fetch` with Next.js caching for PokéAPI calls
- Handle loading states with Skeleton components
- Always handle error states gracefully
